# dear-diary-sketch

This sketch is a visual representation of space that tracks data (observation days) for each planet, which you can interact with and visualize creatively.

Here's what data that can change:

Planet Data: The distance and number of observation days for each planet are the data collected.

User Interaction: By clicking on a planet, you're collecting and visualizing the number of days you've observed it.

Expressive Output: The sketch expresses this data by displaying the planets in a creative and dynamic way, with a visual link between user input (clicks) and the changing data.
